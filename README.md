# Subspace_DS

Package to install before implementing
1. pip install pytesseract - for pytesseract
2. pip install pillow - for PIL
3. pip install cv2 - for using OpenCV


This code implements techniques to extract the "expiry date" of subscription of various mobile applications, provided via screenshot or an actual image of that appliation screen. 
To efficiently extract the text information, I have used OpenCV, Pytesseract and RegEx. 
The things to improve on this suite currently are
1) Image pre-processing
2) Time complexity
